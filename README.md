## How to use

* Click "Choose file" and select a PartsList CSV file exported from BrickLink Studio.
* Click "Buy All" and watch the parts being added to the Pick A Brick list on LEGO.com.
* Instead, you can also manually buy individual items by clicking their "Buy" button.
* Afterwards, you can download a BrickLink XML file that can be used to create a wanted list,
* containing any parts that could not be found on LEGO.com.
* You can also download a CSV file (in the same format as the original file) containing any missing parts.
